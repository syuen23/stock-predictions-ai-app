# Stock Prediction AI App

A quick analysis of stock tickers based on price data from the past few days. ** NOT TRADING ADVICE **

The purpose of this project was to learn more about working with OpenAI's API. I practiced writing prompts, utilizing temperature, the few-shot approach, and max_tokens.

I also learned how to utilize Cloudflare Workers for making calls to the OpenAI API whilst protecting the API key. While doing so, I utilized Cloudflare's AI Gateway to cache and rate limit requests.

## Features

-   Add multiple tickers for analysis
-   Get an AI generated report analyzing each ticker
